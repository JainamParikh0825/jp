        I'm on a journey to become a good Software Engineer ðŸš€. I love building
        little projects, trying out new coding techniques and sharing what I
        learn along the way. I believe that a person should learn new things
        everyday and I try to follow the same principle.

        When I'm not building stuff, I love to watch movies (mostly bollywood)
